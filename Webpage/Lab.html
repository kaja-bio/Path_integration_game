    <section id="introduction">
        <div class="paragraph">Humans, like all other animals, have an innate sense of where we are in the world and where we are going. We use it everywhere - to walk home from a club, to go to the grocery store, to walk from our room to our bathroom at night. Our
        brains use different methods to accurately navigate. Among those is beaconing, a strategy where we use sensory features
        of a distant object to navigate to it - say, ‘Hey, there’s a neon sign here saying ‘Pub’ - that’s probably the entrance
        to the pub, I should move towards it’ or ‘The sound of people screaming getting louder probably means I’m going in the
        right direction for my football match’. But what if you don’t have those clues? This is where path integration comes in. </div>
        <div class="paragraph">Imagine you're out on a hike with your friends. You drive up to the base of a formidable mountain, already regretting having agreed to wake up at 5am to spend the rest of your weekend hot, sweaty, choked by swarms of mosquitos and trudging up a mountain. You put on your best smile as your far fitter friend enthusiastically tells you about the plan - they want to hike to a lake to go for a swim, then make your first ascent up a ridge, go to a mountain hut for some food... With a heavy pack and groaning feet, you zigzag across the area from landmark to landmark, until you finally settle down in the campsite. </div>
        <div class="paragraph">Except - shit. It's the middle of the night and you're woken up in what an optimist would call a 'puddle', and anyone else might label 'a decidedly sizable body of water'.</div>  
        <div class="paragraph">So much for the guy on Facebook Marketplace promising that it was waterproof.</div>
        <div class="paragraph">You and your friend make the decision to trek back to the car park and the warmth. You wish one of you had brought a headlamp at least - you can't use any landmarks to navigate. Despite that, you somehow manage to make it back in one peace, going straight from the campsite to the carpark without any of the diversions you had undertaken on the way there. How did you manage that?</div>
